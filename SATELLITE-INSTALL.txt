ESN Satellite 3 Installation Checklist
--------------------------------------

This is a complimentary document to the standard Drupal installation
procedure (file: INSTALL.txt). It lists some frequent problems you
might find when installing ESN Satellite 3.

All problems here depend on your hosting company. Please ask them for
support if you have problems with one of the items below (or, if you
couldn't install and you don't know where the problem is, send the list
below to your hosting company and ask them if their server satisfies
the requirements).

1) Check that you have PHP 5.2 and MySQL 4.1 or higher.

2) Set memory_limit in php.ini at 64 MBytes or more.

3) Create a MySQL database (and possibly a new user). If creating a
   new user, make sure it has all privileges (except GRANT) on the
   created database. Namely, you need the LOCK TABLES permission too.

4) Check that the rewrite module is enabled on the web server (if
   using Apache httpd).

5) Check filesystem permissions: the directory sites/default/files must
   have read/write permission for the user the web server runs as.
