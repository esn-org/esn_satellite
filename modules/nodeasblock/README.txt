This module allows those with the appropriate permissions the right to create
blocks for each node. By default these blocks display the node title as the
block title and the node teaser as the body. This can be themed by overriding
the theme('nodeasblock', $node) function.

The goal of this module is to break down conceptual barriers between nodes and
blocks.
