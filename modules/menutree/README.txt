ABOUT

This module provides a nested unordered list representation of a complete 
Drupal menu structure.  menutree/1 provides a tree representation of menu 1, 
menutree/2 provides a tree representation of menu 2, etc.  If no ID is 
specified, the primary_links menu is used.  That allows it to be used as a 
simple menu-based sitemap, give or take a path alias.

REQUIREMENTS

- Drupal 4.7

INSTALLATION

- Copy the menutree directory to your modules directory.
- Go to admin/modules and enable it.
- Everything else is handled by the miracle of Drupal 4.7's automated install system.
