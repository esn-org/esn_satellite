It is assumed that you have Drupal up and running.  Be sure to check
the http://drupal.org web site if you need assistance.  If you run
into problems, you should always read the INSTALL.txt that comes with
the Drupal package and read the online documentation.


0. Always backup your database before you enable a new contributed module!


1. Place the signup package into your Drupal modules/ directory.


2. (Optional) Customize the form presented to users when signing up
   for content on your site.  Unfortuantely, this is not yet a way to
   do this from within your site, you must modify a theme function to
   change this form.  See the comment above "theme_signup_user_form()"
   in the signup.theme file.  You can either modify that version of
   the function, or define your own version in your site's theme.


3. Enable the signup module by navigating to:
   Administer > Site building > Modules

   Note: if you want support for automatic closing of events and
   reminder emails you must also install and enable the event package!

   Click the 'Save configuration' button at the bottom to commit your
   changes.


4. For the final configuration of the module, navigate to:
   Administer > Site configuration > Signup

   Here you can configure the options for the module.


5. Enable the node types that you wish to allow signups for under:
   Administer > Content management > Content types

   You may wish to create a new content type specifically for event
   signups using either the Flexinode module or the Content
   Construction Kit (CCK).


6. Grant the proper access to user accounts under:
   Administer > User management > Access control
   
   'sign up for content':
     Allows users to sign up for any content types that are signup-enabled.
     NOTE: Enabling 'sign up for content' for the anonymous user will
     allow anonymous users to sign up by entering an email address.

   'view all signups':
     Allows users to view all of the users who have signed up for any
     signup-enabled content on the site.

   'admininister all signups':
     Implies 'view all signups' permission.  Allows users to view who
     has signed up for nodes, to cancel signups of other users, to
     close signups for specific nodes, and to configure system-wide
     settings related to this module.
   
   'administer signups for own content':
     Allows users to view who has signed up, to cancel signups of
     other users, and to close signups for any nodes that the user owns.

   Viewing the signup report (Administer > Content management > Signup),
   and configuring the module (Administer > Site configuration > Signup)
   are restricted to users who have the 'access administration pages'
   privilege.


7. Start signing up!
