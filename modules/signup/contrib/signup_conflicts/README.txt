signup_conflicts is an add-on for signup module, which allows users and admins
to view any schedule conflicts which exist between signup events.  Simply enable
the module in administer -> modules.  Users will see any schedule conflicts listed
on their user page, and admins will see two additional tabs, 'conflicts' and
'conflict detail', appear in the administer -> signup section.  there is also
an optional block--when enabled it provides the user with a teaser to alert
them of schedule conflicts.

NOTE: this module requires the signup module and the event module to be properly installed.
