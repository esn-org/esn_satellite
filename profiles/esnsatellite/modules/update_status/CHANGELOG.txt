Update Status 5.x-2.0
  o #165695: Added another database update to completely rebuild the menu
    since the "Check manually" path moved to "admin/logs/updates/check".
  o #165638: Improved usability for the "Check manually" link on the
    update report by wrapping it in () and adding some padding.
  o #155483: Simplified the description of the email notification setting.
  o #155878: Re-use the same t() string for both the watchdog() and
    drupal_set_message() when fetching information about available updates.
  o Added or updated translations:
    - Czech (cs)
    - German (de)
    - Greek (el)
    - Hungarian (hu)
    - Italian (it)
    - Norwegian (nb)


Update Status 5.x-2.0-rc2
  o #155483: Backported numerous improvements from update.module in 6.x core:
  == General ==
    - The module now nags site administrators on admin/* if the site is
      missing a security update.
    - Added a drupal_set_message() when fetching data manually (success
      or failure) and cleaned up wording of watchdog().
    - Added watchdog() error message when you can't fetch any data.
    - The menu callback for manually checking is now at 
      'admin/logs/updates/check'.
    - Lots of internal improvements to the code to improve clarity.
  == Available updates report ==
    - Used format_interval() for the "Last checked:" date and time.
    - Removed the "Ignored" part whenever a row on the update report is
      yellow, except for when something is ignored because of the settings.
    - Changed the wording when the "Notification threshold" is set to
      "Only security updates", and you have a non-security update
       available. Now, it just says "Update available".
    - Added support for a variable to override the default fetch URL.
  == Settings page ==
    - Moved the email notification setting to the top of the page.
    - Renamed "Error threshold" to "Notification threshold" and improved
      the description. 
    - Fixed t() bug in form_set_error() during email validation.
    - Removed the setting to opt out of the usage reporting.  No one
      who's willing to run this module in the first place could
      possibly complain about the random string appended as a query arg
      on the fetch URL, and the extra setting needlessly complicates
      the settings page.
  o Fixed a notice on the status report page when the available update
    cache is empty: we were generating a 1/2 constructed line for core
    and a full line for contrib.  Now, if the cache is empty, we just
    generate the warning line for core and nothing for contrib.
  o Fixed minor bug: the status report text was missing a space.
  o Fixed bug caused by variable name typo: $base_util vs. $base_url.
  o Made the status report table all 100% wide for a more consistent UI.
  o #155281: Use flexible path for serving/fetching release history.
  o #155428: Removed the human-readable menu path from the notification
    email since it was considered a burden to translate.
  o Added an implementation of hook_uninstall() to purge variables.
    It's important that when sites running this want to upgrade to 6.x
    core that they first uninstall this module, or they'll be left with
    stale variables.
  o Updated README.txt to reflect recent changes and to mention
    uninstalling the module before upgrading to 6.x core.


Update Status 5.x-2.0-rc
  o #124715: Added setting for email notifications when updates are available.
  o #154868: Fixed bugs and inconsistencies with security update warnings.
  o #153757: Renamed the "Warning threshold" setting to "Error threshold".
  o #149079: A few CSS tweaks and fixes for recommended version:
    - Renamed the CSS class to "version-recommended-strong" to indicate
      it's the strongly recommended version among many (the old name,
      "version-recommended-not-latest" isn't good since "Latest" isn't
      the only possible thing we're distinguishing against).
    - Fixed classes so that if we're recommending a security release,
      it gets the subtle "zebra" stripe, too.
  o #154689: Restored the CSS classes on the per-project settings table,
    (and made them consistent across all rows), but made them more
    specific to avoid name conflicts.
  o Fixed minor glitch in the logic for when to display the
    'Development version'.
  o Fixed bug in hook_version_alter() invocation for CVS deploy
    integration (http://drupal.org/project/cvs_deploy).
  o Updated screenshot to show off recent UI and functionality improvements.

Update Status 5.x-2.0-beta2

    security updates.
  o #153502: Made update_status E_ALL compliant.
  o #154540: Minor wording fixes for the UI and help texts.
  o #153569: Fixed obscure CSS problem for Firefox 2.0.0.4 on Windows XP.
  o #154689: Fixed settings page bug in marvin theme due to CSS class conflict.
  o Don't clear the update_status cache when an admin saves the system
    themes page, since in 5.x, there is no information about theme updates.
  == New features and enhancements ==
  o #153741: Added support for optionally reporting anonymous usage statistics.
  o #153757: Added a setting to only warn when there are security updates.
  o #154049: Added a setting to control how frequently to check for updates.
  o #146564: Major performance gain for fetching available update data:
    directly fetch the .xml files instead of going through the Drupal menu
    callback inside project_release.module.
  o #153783: Don't hard-code dark black (#000) in update_status.css, use
    theme's default foreground color.
  o #149079: Further visual clarity about the recommended version: use a
    subtle "zebra stripe" with a slightly lighter shade of the status
    color for the entire recommended version line.
  o Completely re-wrote the README to match 5.x-2.* reality.

      http://drupal.org/project/cvs_deploy
  o #144694: Available update data now stored in the {cache} table instead
      of the {variables} table for better performance and functionality.
  o #149921: Clear update_status cache when you enable/disable modules.
  o #145095: Core modules were not always considered part of Drupal core.
  o #141507: Fixed bug in the links to manually run cron to find updates.

      ignored due to the settings.
