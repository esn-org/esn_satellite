The following is a wish list for ugrades to this module.  If you'd be
interested in providing financial sponsorship for any of these
features, please email signup@dwwright.net.

* add support limiting signups to certain roles, per node

* make datetime display dependent on medium date format display
  setting in admin/settings

* adding support for custom auto-closing settings per node: time
  before event start, number of signups

* better header info for emails sent to forwarding email address?

* validation of forwarding email addresses

* validation of user submitted data

* catch remote user login and get their email addy (currently signup
  relies on the email addy of a registered user for
  confirmation/reminder emails)

* feature to allow event admins to email signup group

* fix reminder message notification so it doesn't display on signups
  where reminder has already been sent

* make display of reminder email info conditional on whether node is
  event enabled (form edit page)

* better themed user signup form, or better--the ability to
  construct forms on the fly, save them, and select per node!

* wait list feature w/ this workflow:
  1. user visits signup node that is full.  they are shown how many
     people the event holds, how many people are on the wait list
     ahead of them, and given the option to sign up to the wait list.
  2. wait listed user receives an optional wait list confirmation
     email, telling them that they will be notified if they get into
     the event
  3. if the user gets into the event, they receive a confirmation
     email that they are in.
  The three ways that a user would get off the wait list would be:
  1. someonce cancels, and the system automatically lets in the
     person on the top of the wait list
  2. the event coordinator expands the allowed signups for the
     event, and the system automatically lets in the appropriate
     number of waitlisted people
  3. the event coordinator looks through the wait list and manually
     adds someone

* allow a comma seperated list of forwarding email addresses, in
  case there's more than one event coordinator

* event coordinators should also get an email when a user cancels
  their signup

* coordinator can generate a list of attendees that is printable.


FIXES

* signups tab still appears on previously created but now disabled node type
