    <p>ESN&nbsp;Satellite is built on <a href="http://www.drupal.org">Drupal</a>, a powerful open-source content management system. If you want to know more about why we believe Drupal is one of the most powerful systems to date, read the <a href="http://acquia.com/what-is-drupal">&quot;What is Drupal&quot;</a> guide maintained by <a href="http://www.acquia.com">Acquia</a>.</p>
<p>There are no limitations in administering your Satellite, and with over <a href="http://drupal.org/project/modules">4000 modules available</a>, you can easily extend the functionality of your Satellite. And with the new <a href="admin/plugin_manager/">Plugin Manager</a>, you can download and install modules from within your Satellite.</p>
<p>Here are a couple of links if you want to learn more about Drupal:</p>

<li><a href="http://gotdrupal.com/">GotDrupal: An excellent source of videos guiding you through using Views, CCK and other Drupal modules</a></li>

</ul>
<p>And here some basic maintenance tips:</p>
<ul>
<li>In order to <strong>backup</strong> your site it is not enough to copy all the files: configuration (and all site content) is stored in the database, so you will need to save both the files and the database.</li>
<li>It is important to periodically check for <strong>security updates</strong> of Drupal and the modules. You can do this through the Reports menu, but Drupal will do it automatically when you login. To upgrade Drupal, follow the guidelines at <a href="http://drupal.org/upgrade/" class="ext-link">http://drupal.org/upgrade/</a>; to upgrade modules, just remember that all contributed modules are in the profiles/satellite/modules subdirectory.</li>
<li>You might find <a href="http://drupal.org/project/drush" class="ext-link">Drush</a> very handy if you have command-line access to your server.</li>
