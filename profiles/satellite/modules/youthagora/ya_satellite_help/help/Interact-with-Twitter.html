    <p>First of all, <a href="http://www.scientificamerican.com/blog/60-second-science/post.cfm?id=twitter-what-is-it-good-for-2009-02-13">what is Twitter</a>? Our suggestion: make a Twitter account for your section and keep in touch with people through &quot;micro-blogging&quot;, announcing the latest news and changes in programmes on Twitter.</p>
<p>And guess what, you can also have interaction with Twitter on your Satellite, in two ways:</p>
<ul>
<li>Link your Satellite to your Twitter account in the Configuration page. A link to your Twitter will be put on the homepage of the Satellite, in the &quot;Follow us on...&quot; block, so your visitors can easily track you down on Twitter.</li>
<li>Post every article, event, etc. directly on your Twitter account. This requires the setup and configuration of a Drupal module shipped with your Satellite. <a href="http://gotdrupal.com/videos/drupal-twitter-module">Check out this video if you want to learn how.</a></li>
</ul>
