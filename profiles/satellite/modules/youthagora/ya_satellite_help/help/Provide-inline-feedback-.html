    <p>You can provide feedback when you are logged in to the website, for example, to make a suggestion on the page you are browsing, or to report a bug.</p>
<p>Your feedback will be sent to:</p>
<ul>
<li>an internal feedback system managed under Reports &gt; Feedback messages</li>
<li>to the mail addresses of all the users with the editor role on your website</li>
<li>to the ESN&nbsp;Satellite Google Groups, where it will be held under moderation. If your feedback message is relevant to the ESN&nbsp;Satellite community, it will be published, so the community can react on it</li>
</ul>
<p>Internally, all those actions are managed by the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules module</a>. If you want, you can configure your own actions to be executed when a feedback message is posted (eg send it to the admin email address) by configuring the appropriate rules. Make sure to enable the &quot;Rules Administration UI&quot; module first.</p>
