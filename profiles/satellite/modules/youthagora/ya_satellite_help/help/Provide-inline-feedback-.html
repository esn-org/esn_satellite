    <div class="warning">Do you wish to join the <strong>ESN Webteam,</strong> and help out with the ESN Satellite and other ESN web projects? You could help us out with <strong>coding</strong>, writing <strong>documentation</strong>, <strong>PR</strong>, or whatever you wish to get involved with. Drop us an email at <a href="mailto:webteam@esn.org?subject=I%20wish%20to%20join%20the%20ESN%20Webteam&amp;body=I%20want%20to%20help%20out%20with%20...">webteam@esn.org</a>.</div>

<p>You can provide feedback when you are logged in to the website, for example, to make a suggestion on the page you are browsing, or to report a bug.</p>
<p>Your feedback will be sent to:</p>
<ul>
<li>an internal feedback system managed under Reports &gt; Feedback messages</li>
<li>to the mail addresses of all the users with the editor role on your website</li>
<li>to <em>satellite@esn.org</em>, where it will be reviewed by the ESN&nbsp;Webteam. If your feedback message is relevant to the ESN&nbsp;Satellite community, it will be published to the ESN&nbsp;Satellite Google Groups, so the community can react on it</li>
</ul>
<p>Internally, all those actions are managed by the <a href="http://drupal.org/project/rules">Rules module</a>. If you want, you can configure your own actions to be executed when a feedback message is posted (eg send it to the admin email address) by configuring the appropriate rules. Make sure to enable the &quot;Rules Administration UI&quot; module first.</p>
