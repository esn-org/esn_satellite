<p>
Your section name, address and country are imported from the <a target="_blank" href="http://galaxy.esn.org">ESN Galaxy</a>, and configured locally in the <b>Satellite Configuration</b> page. If you wish to make updates in your address, for example, you need to: 
</p>
<ol>
  <li>login with your <b>ESN Identity</b> account on the <a target="_blank" href="http://galaxy.esn.org">ESN Galaxy</a> and change your section or country information.</li>
  <li>reload your sections settings page to reflect the latest settings from ESN Identity. You can find your Satellite Configuration page <a target="_blank" href="/?q=node/244/edit">here</a></li>
</ol>

<p>
Note that:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>you need the right privileges to change your section or country information. Only the President of your section, the National Representative of your country and the Web Projects Administrator of ESN International can change that information.</li>
  <li>you need to wait 8 hours in orders for the changes to take effect, or you can run <b>cron</b> to reflect the latest changes of the ESN Galaxy immediately on your Satellite. You can run cron by going to <a href="cron.php">cron.php</a></li>
</ul>
