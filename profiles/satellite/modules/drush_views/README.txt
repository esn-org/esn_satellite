DESCRIPTION
-----------

drush_views.module (The Drupal Shell Views interface) allows you to list, import and export views from the command line.

It provides three commands, "views list", "views import", and "views export".

Run "drush help views list", "drush help views import" or  "drush help views export" to see supported command line options and arguments.

REQUIREMENTS
------------
No special requirements on unix-like systems.
drush_views uses the ordinary PHP commands for file and directory handling, but it is still untested on Windows.
